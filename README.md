# dsa-doubts to ask 
Sure! Here are ten challenging C++ questions that can help you test and improve your understanding of the language, particularly focusing on data structures and algorithms:

1. **Implement a Trie (Prefix Tree)**
   - Implement a Trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.
   - Optimize for memory and performance.

2. **LRU Cache**
   - Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
   - It should support get and put operations with O(1) time complexity.

3. **Thread-safe Singleton**
   - Implement a thread-safe Singleton pattern in C++.
   - Ensure the implementation is lazy-loaded and efficient.

4. **Graph Algorithms: Dijkstra’s Shortest Path**
   - Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.
   - Optimize for time and space complexity.

5. **Custom Memory Allocator**
   - Implement a custom memory allocator in C++.
   - It should support basic operations like malloc, free, and possibly more advanced features like memory pooling.

6. **AVL Tree**
   - Implement an AVL tree with insertion, deletion, and balancing operations.
   - Ensure all operations maintain the AVL tree properties.

7. **Concurrent Data Structures**
   - Implement a thread-safe queue using C++11 or higher concurrency features.
   - Ensure it supports concurrent enqueues and dequeues.

8. **Serialization and Deserialization of a Binary Tree**
   - Implement functions to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.
   - Ensure the serialized format is space-efficient.

9. **Topological Sort**
   - Implement a function to perform a topological sort on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
   - Optimize for both time and space complexity.

10. **Manacher’s Algorithm**
    - Implement Manacher’s algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.
    - Optimize the solution to run in linear time.
